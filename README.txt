#Ruby basic projects from Odin Project

Using Ruby I created those methods:
1 - Caesar Cipher method which changes the letters of the words depending on the shift value you input.
2 - Substring method which detects all the words from an input text that is included in a dictionary like array, and count all the times the words have been mentioned.
3 - Stock picker method which calculates the best day to buy and sell a stock by analysing the prices for each day of the stock.
