# Ruby basic projects from Odin Project

Using Ruby I created these methods:

1. **Caesar Cipher** – Shifts letters in a string based on a numeric input.

2. **Substring** – Detects and counts occurrences of dictionary words in a given text.

3. **Stock Picker** – Calculates the best day to buy and sell stock based on price trends.

4. **Bubble Sort** – Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
